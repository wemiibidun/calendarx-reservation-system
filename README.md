## Introduction

**CalendarX** was created to practice working with custom objects, local storage, user input handling, visual data feedback, and responsive design using **vanilla JavaScript, jQuery UI, and Google Charts**. It’s a dynamic reservation system where users can book time slots, edit them, and see a visual summary of all reservations made.
